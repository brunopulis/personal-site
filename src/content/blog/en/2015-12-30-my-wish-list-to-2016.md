### My wish list to 2016

Hi, this is my first article in english :D

2016 is comming, so I decided to create goals for my professional life.  
I am planning to study to improve my skills. I will follow this list of goals.

-   TDD, BDD;
-   Some tool for deploying;
-   Javascript Patterns;
-   Javascript OO;
-   MEAN Stack;
-   Mongo University;
-   [Complete Course Computer Science](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science);

So, come 2016!
