Hi, this is my first article in englishÂ :D

2016 is comming, so I decided to create goals for my professional life.

I am planning to study to improve my skills. I will follow this list of goals.

- TDD, BDD;

- Some tool for deploying;

- Javascript Patterns;
- Javascript OO;
- MEAN Stack;
- Mongo University;
- [Complete Course Computer Science](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science);

So, come 2016!
